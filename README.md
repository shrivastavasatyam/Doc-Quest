# Doc-Quest
DocQuest is an offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages embeddings and LLMs to efficiently search and retrieve technical documentation, delivering accurate, context-aware answers. It currently supports Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn documentation, with the flexibility to extend support for more libraries and tools.
